# What is SmartFan?
Course project of *Engineering Practice*(SJTU ME210. It's actual name is *A Smart Leafless Fan Based on Arduino*. 

It has some interesting features:
1. The air volume can be changed according to the distance between the user and the fan.

2. It can intelligently identify whether the user has left and then turn off the fan.

3. It can rotate.

Rather than looking at text, it is better to look at pictures & videos.
